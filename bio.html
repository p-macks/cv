    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>After finishing my A levels, stuck on exactly what was the way forward,
       with little career guidance and resources back then in the rural areas Filabusi
       i had a choice to either join the impoverished Zimbabwean civil service or
        apply for an apprenticeship (a government subsidized skills learning programme). <br>
        With little effort succeeded in being part of an apprenticeship with an engineering group
        which specialized in maintenance of hydraulic and pneumatic plant machines. Passing my theory 
        in Machineshop engineering also was a walk in the park and the nightmare started when 
        failed to get fulfilliment in the practical aspect of my job. My foreman and other colleagues 
        were satisfied with my work but personally couldn't and that's when thought a career change 
        would do justice to situation. <br>
        While at the maintenance shop came across CNC machines and being fascinated by their speed 
        in producing a month's workload in a few hours made me curious.
        My programming desire started and since then have always been inspired by ideas that makes 
        everyday human lives easy
